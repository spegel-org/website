Spegel is an open project where everyone is welcome to contribute, discuss, and improve the tool. Whether you want to share ideas, report issues, or help with development, your input matters.

## Meeting

We meet every Tuesday at 17:00 CET to discuss Spegel development, improvements, and ideas. Everyone is welcome to join!
To keep discussions organized, please add topics to the agenda beforehand. This helps ensure we cover everything efficiently.

Whether you're new to Spegel or a long-time contributor, your input is valuable. See you there!
