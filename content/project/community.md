Spegel is an open project where everyone is welcome to contribute, discuss, and improve the tool. Whether you want to share ideas, report issues, or help with development, your input matters.

## Slack

Join the **#spegel** channel in the [Kubernetes Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/kubernetes/community) to chat about Spegel. This is a great place for discussions, questions, and ideas—whether you're exploring Spegel or already using it, we’d love to hear from you! For bug reports and feature requests, please create an issue on GitHub.

## Meeting

We meet every Tuesday at 17:00 CET to discuss Spegel development, improvements, and ideas. Everyone is welcome to join!
To keep discussions organized, please add topics to the agenda beforehand. This helps ensure we cover everything efficiently.

Whether you're new to Spegel or a long-time contributor, your input is valuable. See you there!
